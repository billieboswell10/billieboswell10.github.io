<h1 style="color: #ffffff"> About Billie's Music</h1>
<h3>First Stages</h3>
<p>Billie first took interest in music in first grade when she asked her mom to put her into piano lessons. For years Billie continued to practice and play but could not decide if she loved it or not. As piano got more difficult, Billie started to get extremely frustrated by how technical music had become. In about seventh grade after taking music lessons for about six years, Billie mastered her first real piece of music: Fur Elise by Ludwig van Beethoven. After that it was pretty clear to Billie what she was meant to do; however, it would take a lot of dedication.  After about four years, Billie was a sophomore at The Academy of Richmond County as was a student in the International Baccalaureate Program. Before their Junior Year, International Baccalaureate students choose one elective along with six other finite classes that were pre-scheduled. Billie had to choose between Music, her passion, or Economics, her college career. After a few weeks of deliberation, Billie decided that she had the rest of her life to learn economics but only these two years to master music before college. She chose International Baccalaureate Music.  .</p>
<h3>International Baccalaureate Higher Level Music</h3>
<p>The International Baccalaureate Program (IB Program) is a two year course that consists of seven IB courses one of which is a chosen higher level elective by the student. At the end of the two years, a portfolio assessment is due and shipped off over-seas to be graded by certified graders. This portfolio consists of multiple time consuming components. The first is a 2,500 word ‘Musical Links Essay’ which takes two pieces of completely different types of music from different time periods and they must be compared and contrasted. Billie did her Musical Links on ‘Stairway to Heaven’ by Led Zeppelin and ‘Clair de Lune’ by Claude Debussey. The second component, is twenty two minutes of live recorded performance. Billie had been performing for years while researching her idol, Pytor Tchaikovsky, and this was one of the easiest components for her. The third component is nine minutes of original composition. To Billie, this was the most difficult but was a great skill for her to learn. </p>
<p> Due to the time consumption that The IB program required, Billie had to come up with a schedule for her practices</p>

<h3>Performance and post-graduation</h3>
<p>While Billie was taking music classes, she also spent time outside of school excelling in music. Every year she performed for the Augusta Symphony Guild, multiple weddings amd private parties. Even after performing for years, she always had to do the same excat routine right before she performed. This routine consisted of her tilting her neck from left to right, popping each individual finger quickly from index to middle and taking a deep breathe with her hands in her lap. Even after Billie graduated from high school, she still practices the piano at her college. Billie decided against playing the piano for her university because she knows that that would require hours of practice of day which she cannot do with her business classes on her schedule too. About three times a week, Billie goes to her father’s house and practices on her own personal piano. Billie still performs for small events when she has time. </p>
